# REST API with SpringBoot: Blog Manager API (CBF Assessment)
  
I've created a blog object which has the attributes: 
- id
- date
- author
- title
- content

The blogService has the methods that can be carried out on the blog, such as:
- read (all, one item)
- create
- update
- delete 

The blogController calls the service to do stuff to the blog and create mappings to different endpoints.

I have a JSONHandler which handles serialisation and deserialization of my json file (the in-memory repository).

I have an Algorithm class that has methods to search terms in blog content and blog author and sort blog posts by date.

## The Endpoints
- /blog/blogs: returns all blogs
- /blog/blogs/author=author: return blogs with specified authors
- /blog/blogs/orderByOldest: returns all blogs ordered from oldest to most recent
- /blog/blogs/orderByLatest: returns all blogs ordered from most recent to oldest
- /blog/id: returns a blog with specified id
- /blog: create a blog post
- /blog/id: update a blog with specified id
- /blog/id: delete a blog with specified id
- /blog/blogs/keyword=keyword: return blogs with specified keyword in content
